****************Refactor**************
Assembler::generate_obj requires massive refactor
    too much confusing code/structure - each section appendment should be own function
    section header m_name index into shstrtab is hardcoded
    restructure code to make easier to understand/modify in the future
    
Need to reenable all warnings and fix those

**************Automatic testing************
Automate tests for compiler - refactors are getting dangerous with just hand-written tests
    have tests test output of programs:
        print(3)
        print(4)

        Should print 3 and 4 on separate lines - automate this with bash/python scripts

**************IR Trees*************************
!Big refactor!
Have semant.cpp output an intermediate representation
Make Optimizer that optimizes IR tree
Make Ir_x86_translator generate x86 from IR

struct IRExpr {

};

struct IRStmt {

};

**********************Linker*******************************
Test using three or more files with more complex dependencies
    main -> complex_math -> math

    main -> math
    main -> other_lib

refactor Link::link() so that load address 0x08048000 is not hard coded in Link::link() a bunch of times
    should remove patch_addr_offsets in assembler.cpp and ORG keyword in assembler.hpp - not using this now since linker will 
        take care of load address offset now

How should print be part of linking process?
    Could have library written in assembly and compiled to .obj file
    Have function declarations inside of compiler already to type check
    Link library at link time - link standard library
*********************Documentation****************

Start writing out README file
    can we use that markup language (not html) to format document?
        this seems like a good chance to learn something easier than html
    Motivation
        Why build this? To learn more about the tools
        Why use C? Curious about limitations
    Diagram
    Modules
            TODO: produce non-executable ELF files (to allow linking with other files)
        Linker
            TODO: need to make this

    Building

    ELF executables have read-only and read/write sections:
        using a read/write section will require main function/global variables
