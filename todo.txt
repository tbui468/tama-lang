****************Refactor**************
Assembler::generate_obj requires massive refactor
    too much confusing code/structure - each section appendment should be own function
    section header m_name index into shstrtab is hardcoded
    restructure code to make easier to understand/modify in the future
    
Need to reenable all warnings and fix those

**************Automatic testing************
Automate tests for compiler - refactors are getting dangerous with just hand-written tests
    have tests test output of programs:
        print(3)
        print(4)

        Should print 3 and 4 on separate lines - automate this with bash/python scripts

**************IR Trees*************************
!Big refactor!
Have semant.cpp output an intermediate representation
Make Optimizer that optimizes IR tree
Make Ir_x86_translator generate x86 from IR

struct IRExpr {

};

struct IRStmt {

};

**********************Linker*******************************
rel->m_offset is WAAAY too big - right now it's the offset from file beginning, NOT from the text section beginning
    need to offset this when makeing the .obj file in the assembler - but need access to the .text section
link function needs to:
    try using new 'get_section_header' function - there are a few places in Linker::link that is can be used besides just relocation <----start here!
        then use it to apply relocations

    apply relocations when using more than one file
        getting __add undefined when attempting to assemble main.asm into main.obj
            Solution!!! just remove this from patch_rel_jumps - undefined symbols will be changed into a relocation entry
            when assembler makes a relocatable ELF

        when applying relocations, if symbol doesn't exist in any module, then report a linking error
            skip undefined symbol and try linking other symbols so that all linking errors can be reported one time
    try linking math.tmd along with main.tmd
    refactor Link::link() into a few smaller functions (eg, patch_entry_addr() when finding 'main' function)
    refactor Link::link() so that load address 0x08048000 is not hard coded in Link::link() a bunch of times

Use readelf to analyze .o files
    Compile to 32-bit elf:
        gcc -c -mx32 test.c (will output test.o)
        gcc -c -m elf_i386 main.c (same as -mx32?)
        use -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables to get rid of eh_frame (what's the purpose of this?)

    readelf -h test.o (see header)

    readelf -x .text test.o (hexdump text section)

*********************Documentation****************

Start writing out README file
    can we use that markup language (not html) to format document?
        this seems like a good chance to learn something easier than html
    Motivation
        Why build this? To learn more about the tools
        Why use C? Curious about limitations
    Diagram
    Modules
            TODO: produce non-executable ELF files (to allow linking with other files)
        Linker
            TODO: need to make this

    Building

    ELF executables have read-only and read/write sections:
        using a read/write section will require main function/global variables
