**************IR Trees*************************
!Big refactor!
Have semant.cpp output an intermediate representation
Make Optimizer that optimizes IR tree
Make Ir_x86_translator generate x86 from IR

struct IRExpr {

};

struct IRStmt {

};

*********************Documentation****************

Start writing out README file
    can we use that markup language (not html) to format document?
        this seems like a good chance to learn something easier than html
    Motivation
        Why build this? To learn more about the tools
        Why use C? Curious about limitations
    Diagram
    Modules
            TODO: produce non-executable ELF files (to allow linking with other files)
        Linker
            TODO: need to make this

    Building

    ELF executables have read-only and read/write sections:
        using a read/write section will require main function/global variables


********************Resources******************

Read a little more of Ian Lance Taylor's blog or 'Linkers and Loaders'
    to understand differences between ELF relocatable files and ELF executable files
Watch 'Understanding Compiler Optimization - Chandler Carruth' on youtube
