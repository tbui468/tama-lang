Read lecture 14, lecture 15, lecture 16
Read 240 TAC examples


<---------------get this working--------------->
_start:
    t0 = call main
    push_arg 0
    call _exit

<---------------implement these--------------->
Return
    * return an int
    return t0

    * return void
    return

Call
    * function call with void return
    push_arg
    call    label
    pop_args

    * for function calls with non-void return
    t0 = call label
If
While

Will need to deal with scope/locals/type-checking/etc when emitting ir
    currently just assuming everything is declared/correct type, etc

***************************Reorganize Quads basic-blocks*********************
    Each instruction after label is start of block - the leader (this takes care of function definitions)
    Start at each leader and move down quads until we find next leader - previous is end of block (also takes care of functions)
    Need to create CFG during this time (nodes are blocks, and edges (jumps) connect blocks)

    class TacBlock {
        public:
            TacLabel* m_label;
            TacQuad* m_begin;
            TacQuad* m_end; //one after end of block
    };

    std::vector<TacBloc> m_blocks;
    
    struct TacEdge {
        int m_from;
        int m_to;
        TacEdge(int from, int to): m_from(from), m_to(to) {}
    };


****************Control-Flow Graph**********************
What about trace scheduling? (Mentioned in Modern Compiler Implementation in C book, but not in standford lectures)

***************Optimization********************
just do constant folding or something simple for now

***************Allocate registers*********************

******************Emit x86 from TAC***********************
Use assembler and linker to check if final output works

*********************Documentation****************

Start writing out README file
    can we use that markup language (not html) to format document?
        this seems like a good chance to learn something easier than html
    Motivation
        Why build this? To learn more about the tools
        Why use C? Curious about limitations
    Diagram
    Modules
            TODO: produce non-executable ELF files (to allow linking with other files)
        Linker
            TODO: need to make this

    Building

    ELF executables have read-only and read/write sections:
        using a read/write section will require main function/global variables
