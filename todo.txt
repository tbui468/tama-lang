**************Automatic testing************
Bug:
    class AstImport needs correct path for .tmd files
        it works differently for bash scripts and python scripts
        the bash script needs to prefix from /build/src
        but python script doesn't since inside /test already

IDV and CDQ not implemented in assembler

**************IR Trees*************************
!Big refactor!
Have semant.cpp output an intermediate representation
Make Optimizer that optimizes IR tree
Make Ir_x86_translator generate x86 from IR

struct IRExpr {

};

struct IRStmt {

};

**********************Basic Library*******************************
Basic library can be an .asm file for system calls
Make a file basic.tmd with empty bodies just for type checking during import of 'basic'
How to deal with overloading functions (eg, print(5) vs print(true))
    just using AST to deal with this currently
*********************Documentation****************

Start writing out README file
    can we use that markup language (not html) to format document?
        this seems like a good chance to learn something easier than html
    Motivation
        Why build this? To learn more about the tools
        Why use C? Curious about limitations
    Diagram
    Modules
            TODO: produce non-executable ELF files (to allow linking with other files)
        Linker
            TODO: need to make this

    Building

    ELF executables have read-only and read/write sections:
        using a read/write section will require main function/global variables
